"""Page conventions, checked lexically.

Nothing in this suite executes web/*.js or renders index.html, so the
conventions the page depends on are enforced by reading its source -- the
same approach test_bridge_contract.py, test_engine_invariants.py and
test_no_tk.py already take, and for the same reason: "to stop something
that was removed on purpose creeping back."

Every rule below is here because it was BROKEN at least once, shipped, and
was found by eye rather than by a test:

- Bare checkboxes rendered as native white Win32 controls on a dark card,
  one per character, on a screen whose sibling module carried a comment
  warning about exactly that.
- A destructive confirmation raised browser chrome captioned with the page
  origin, under a comment claiming it was what the rest of the page did.
- Field labels outside the shared label column rendered brighter than
  every other label and at three different widths.
- An element given `hidden` stayed visible, because its class sets a
  display and an author rule beats the UA stylesheet's [hidden] rule
  regardless of specificity. The CSS documents this trap in six places,
  which is six times it was nearly missed.

These are deliberately mechanical. They cannot judge whether a screen is
well designed; they only stop a convention being dropped silently. What
they cannot see is recorded in DESIGN.md.
