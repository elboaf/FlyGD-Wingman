# Smoke checklist

Manual verification for the GUI and live upload paths, which are not
automated: doing so would need live credentials and would consume the very
upload quota the design is constrained by.

Run on Windows against a real install before each release.

## Install
- [ ] Installer runs without an admin prompt
- [ ] Start Menu shortcut launches the app
- [ ] With "start at login" checked, the app appears after a reboot
- [ ] Uninstall removes the app and leaves `%LOCALAPPDATA%` state intact

## First run
- [ ] Recording folder is pre-filled from OBS config without being asked
- [ ] With OBS absent, the folder picker appears instead
- [ ] Existing recordings do NOT produce a notification on first launch
- [ ] **Missing ffmpeg disables Stitch instead of breaking the app.**
      Rename `bin\ffmpeg.exe` inside the install directory so it fails to
      resolve, then start the app. Expected: the app still starts and
      lists recordings normally; the Stitch checkbox is disabled with an
      explanatory "(ffmpeg not found — stitching unavailable)" label.
      Restore the binary afterward.

## Watcher
- [ ] Recording in OBS then stopping produces one notification
- [ ] Notification does not steal focus from a fullscreen game
- [ ] Clicking the tray icon opens the uploader window
- [ ] With `notify_mode: popup`, the window raises instead
- [ ] A recording made while the app was closed is announced on next launch
- [ ] Existing recordings are NOT re-announced on an ordinary restart
- [ ] Newly announced recordings are already checked when the window opens
- [ ] **Persistent watcher failure surfaces exactly one notification.** Make
      the recording folder unreachable while the app is running (rename it,
      or unmount the drive it's on). After roughly 15 seconds, expect ONE
      tray notification that the watcher is having trouble — not one every
      poll cycle, and not silence. Restore the folder and confirm polling
      resumes normally afterward.
- [ ] **A file deleted outside the app and recreated at the same path.**
      With the app running, delete a recording in Explorer, then create a
      new file at that exact path. This is a known limitation of the
      seen-entry tracking: the recreated file may not be re-announced until
      the app restarts. That is expected behavior, not a bug to report.

## Settings
- [ ] Settings button opens the dialog
- [ ] Connect Google Account opens a browser and reports "Connected"
- [ ] **Close the Settings dialog while a Google sign-in is in flight.**
      Click Connect Google Account, then close the Settings window before
      completing (or without completing) the browser sign-in. The OAuth
      worker thread later calls back into the now-destroyed window.
      Expected: at worst a traceback printed to stderr; no crash of the
      app, no corrupted settings file, and the tray icon keeps working.
- [ ] Changing privacy and saving persists across an app restart
- [ ] Changing the recording folder takes effect without a restart —
      new recordings in the NEW folder are announced, old folder is ignored
- [ ] Switching notify mode to popup takes effect on the next recording,
      without a restart
- [ ] A non-numeric category ID is rejected with a warning

## Combat logs
- [ ] **No webhook configured.** Clear the Discord webhook field (or use a
      fresh install), select a recording, and click **Upload combat logs**.
      Expected: a warning dialog naming the problem ("Enter a Discord
      webhook URL.") and directing you to add one in Settings. No thread is
      started, no archive is written.
- [ ] **An invalid webhook URL is refused on Save.** In Settings, paste a
      URL that is not a Discord webhook (e.g. `https://example.com/hook`,
      or `https://discord.com.evil.example/api/webhooks/1/x`) and click
      **Save**. Expected: a warning naming the problem, the dialog stays
      open, and NOTHING is written to `settings.json` — reopen Settings and
      confirm the old value is still there. Then clear the field entirely
      and Save: that must succeed, since an empty webhook simply means the
      feature is unconfigured. `parse_webhook` itself has unit tests, but
      the dialog wiring that calls it does not, so this is the only check
      that the Save path honors the validator's rejection.
- [ ] **The webhook summary label tracks what you type.** In Settings, with
      a webhook already configured, paste a *different* valid webhook URL
      over it. Expected: the summary line underneath updates immediately to
      the new webhook's id — it must not keep describing the previous one.
      Type something invalid and it reads "not configured"; clear the field
      and it reads "not configured" too. At no point does the label show the
      token portion of the URL.
- [ ] **Gamelogs folder not found.** Rename your `Gamelogs` folder (or run
      from an account with no EVE install) with no `gamelogs_dir` set in
      Settings, then click **Upload combat logs**. Expected: a warning
      dialog saying the Gamelogs folder could not be found, telling you to
      set it in Settings. Then open Settings → **Detect** next to Gamelogs
      with the real folder present: it fills in the entry. Click **Detect**
      again with the field already set to that path: a dialog says it's
      already set to the detected folder, rather than silently re-filling it.
- [ ] **A normal successful upload.** Select one or more recordings from a
      real fight, click **Upload combat logs**. Expected: status label
      steps through "Collecting combat logs…" → "Building archive…" →
      "Posting to Discord…" → a green "Posted \<name\>.zip (N KB)." message.
      In Discord, the message names the character(s) and file count, and
      the attached zip contains a `manifest.json` plus the `.txt` logs. The
      temp archive under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...\tmp` is gone afterward.
- [ ] **Selection spanning one fight in multiple clips posts ONE archive.**
      Select three clips that together cover one continuous fight. Expected:
      a single upload covering the earliest start to the latest end across
      all three — not three separate posts.
- [ ] **No readable duration (ffprobe missing/failed).** Rename
      `bin\ffprobe.exe` in the install directory, then select a recording and
      click **Upload combat logs**. Expected: a warning dialog titled
      "Cannot determine the time window" that lists the specific recording
      filename(s) affected and mentions ffprobe. No thread is started.
      Restore the binary afterward.
- [ ] **A window matching no logs.** Pick a recording (or a time range) far
      from any real EVE session, or point Gamelogs at an empty folder, and
      upload. Expected: an info dialog "No EVE logs overlap that window,"
      showing the window in UTC and the folder path, and stating plainly
      that EVE timestamps are UTC. The status label reads "No combat logs
      found." No archive is left behind.
- [ ] **A failed post (e.g. a deleted webhook).** Configure a webhook, then
      delete it in Discord's channel settings without updating the app, and
      upload. Expected: an error dialog "Combat log upload failed" whose
      message explains the webhook is invalid/deleted, AND explicitly shows
      the archive's path so it can be uploaded by hand. Confirm the file at
      that path still exists after the dialog — a failed post must never
      delete the archive.
- [ ] **Settings dialog at 100% and 150% Windows display scaling.** Open
      Settings at each scale factor and confirm all five sections (Google
      account, Upload defaults, When a recording finishes, Discord (combat
      logs), Recording folder) are fully visible with nothing clipped, and
      that Save/Cancel are reachable without resizing. A previous release
      shipped with a section clipped off the bottom of the dialog at high
      DPI, and the new Discord webhook/Gamelogs fields are exactly the kind
      of addition that could reintroduce it.
- [ ] **Combat-log and YouTube uploads share one busy guard.** Start a
      combat-log upload for a large-enough window that it takes a moment,
      then immediately click **Upload Selected** (YouTube). Expected: the
      "An upload is already in progress" warning. Then do the reverse —
      start a YouTube upload, immediately click **Upload combat logs** —
      and confirm the same warning appears there too.

## Upload
- [ ] **First upload triggers Google sign-in automatically, without
      Settings.** Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OBSYouTubeUploader\token.json`
      first, so no token is stored. Select a recording and click **Upload
      Selected** directly — do not open Settings. Expected: the browser
      opens for Google sign-in, and once you consent, the upload proceeds
      on its own. This is the automatic reauth path in the upload worker,
      separate from the Settings → Connect Google Account button, and is
      likely the most common first-run route (install, see recordings,
      upload, never touch Settings).
- [ ] Single upload completes and the link column fills in
- [ ] Copy button puts a working URL on the clipboard
- [ ] Open button opens the video in a browser
- [ ] Multi-select without stitch uploads each with `(1/n)` titles
- [ ] Each row gets its own correct link
- [ ] Stitch of two videos produces one upload, both rows show the same link
- [ ] Temp stitch file is gone from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...\tmp` afterwards
- [ ] Killing the network mid-upload shows "retrying in Ns", then resumes
- [ ] After exhausting retries, the Retry button becomes enabled
- [ ] Retry resumes rather than restarting from 0%
- [ ] Retry of a 3-file batch that failed on file 2 uploads files 2 and 3,
      and fills in links for both
- [ ] Retry of a failed STITCHED upload re-stitches and restarts (expected —
      the temp file is deleted on failure by design)
- [ ] Temp stitch file is gone even after a failed upload
- [ ] **Non-retryable upload failure disables Retry.** Trigger a hard API
      error rather than a network blip — either exhaust the shared daily
      quota, or revoke the app's access from your Google account's
      permissions page and then upload. Expected: a plain-language error
      dialog (not a traceback or stack trace), and the Retry button stays
      DISABLED, since retrying cannot help. This is a distinct code path
      from the "kill the network" case above — confirm Retry's state
      differs between the two.

## Delete
- [ ] Confirmation dialog lists the correct filenames
- [ ] Cancelling deletes nothing
- [ ] Confirming removes the files and refreshes the list
- [ ] A deleted file is not re-announced by the watcher

## Single instance
- [ ] Launching a second copy exits quietly with no second tray icon
- [ ] The first instance keeps working normally afterwards
- [ ] **Tray Quit actually exits.** Right-click the tray icon and choose
      Quit. Expected: the process ends, the tray icon disappears (no
      orphaned icon lingering until Explorer refreshes it away), and no
      background process remains running.

## Release
- [ ] **Version-consistency check catches a mismatch.** Bump one of
      `pyproject.toml`, `obs_youtube_uploader/__init__.py`, or
      `packaging/installer.iss`'s `AppVersion` (but not the other two),
      push, and confirm CI's "Check version consistency" step fails and
      names all three versions, including the mismatched one.
